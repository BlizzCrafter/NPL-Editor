NPL Editor is a modern, powerful, and completely standalone tool that revolutionizes your MonoGame content pipeline workflow. Building upon the robust foundations of **[MGCB Editor](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/tools/mgcb_editor.html)** and **[NoPipeline](https://github.com/Martenfur/Nopipeline)**, it delivers an enhanced, user-friendly experience designed for speed, flexibility, and reliability.

# Setup NPL Editor

1. Build NPLEditor in Release mode which generates the nuget packages inside the root of the project.
2. Now open the root, click inside the adress bar of the explorer and type-in "cmd" (which opens a command prompt pointing to the root).
3. Install NPLEditor as a global dotnet tool like this: `dotnet tool install NPLEditor --add-source ..\ -g`
4. Install NPLEditor.Task locally to your desired MonoGame project.
   - You probably want to move the nuget package to a custom directory beforehand.
   - Alternatively: Copy the NPLEditor.Task.targets file directly to your MonoGame project root.
5. Install the [NPLEditor.VSExtension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BlizzCrafter.NPLEditor) via Visual Studio.
6. Profit ???

Yes! It should be possible now to double click the **Content.npl** file inside your **Content** folder to open the **NPL Editor**. 

Everything you change inside this editor will modify the corresponding **Content.npl** file now ðŸ¥³.

# Benefits of NPL Editor

- Completely free from NoPipeline and MonoGame.ContentBuilder.Task dependencies, NPL Editor runs 100% on its own!
- **Incremental Build Mode:** Automatically rebuild only the changed content within multiple `.npl` content files simultaneously!
- **Dynamic Pipeline Imports:** Automatically detects and imports pipeline references of MonoGame and your own custom ones!
- **Enhanced Logging:** Real-time, organized logging with adjustable verbosity keeps you informed at every step!
- **Smart Build Process:** Powered by [MonoGame.RuntimeBuilder](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MonoGame.RuntimeBuilder), it tracks file dependencies and supports dynamic runtime modifications to the build process as well as detecting multiple importers with the same file extensions!
- **Seamless Content Editing:** Eliminate JSON formatting errors â€“ NPL Editor handles your `.npl` files flawlessly!
- **Intelligent Dependency Tracking:** Modify one content item and see all dependent assets automatically rebuilt!
- **Backward Compatibility:** Supports legacy NPL keywords (like "watch") from NoPipeline for a smooth transition!
- **Debug-Friendly Task Integration:** Use the new NPLEditor.Task nuget to build content on the fly during debugging without launching the full GUI!
- **Advanced Parameter Parsing:** Control log levels and other settings easily via additional launch parameters.
- **Extended Content Management:** Enjoy enhanced content handling that supports environment variables and wildcards. For example, you can add content as follows:

>     "%PROGRAMFILES%\YourLibDir\Library.dll"
>     "..\RelativePath\RelativeLibrary.dll"
>     "D:\OtherPath\**\*.png"
